## Description

As a web developer it is important to have a striking portofolio webpage.
The portfolio is an addition to a CV and can greatly enhance chances of finding interesting work.
Throughout this project i was able to investigate how flex boxes work. I was also able to use the @media
in order to instigate changes when using different viewing screens.
